# Music-Recommendation-System-Fine-Tuned-Music-Suggestions-Based-on-deep-learning-and-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on creating an advanced music recommendation system to transform the music streaming experience. The surge in music streaming popularity has generated extensive user data, critical for tailoring recommendations to individual tastes. Our system utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze user interaction data, including listening histories and contextual information, addressing the shortcomings of traditional, simplistic algorithms. We harness the Million Song Dataset and implement advanced algorithms such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), K-Nearest Neighbor, and Neural Collaborative Filtering, coupled with matrix factorization. These methods are designed to enhance recommendation accuracy and personalization, offering a more engaging user experience. The integration of song and artist metadata further refines our recommendations. We assess the systemâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  The aim is to develop a recommendation system that not only exceeds current market standards in accuracy and user satisfaction but also contributes to the scholarly field of music recommendation. By leveraging the power of deep learning, our project leads innovation in music streaming, envisioning a future where each listener's experience is as unique as their musical preferences.
